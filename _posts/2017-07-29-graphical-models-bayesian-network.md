# Generative Adversarial Networks

Thttp://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/bnintro.html#decision

## Multiple correct answers
What Ian meant by having multiple correct answers is that your lists of possible
outcomes allowed from your model is more than one. For example, if you are trying
to predict cats, dogs, and human. We might not be able to distinguish that a given input is either one, but we are able to say that it is possible that the input is
one of the things in the list. Therefore, the input is accepted.

## Learn useful embeddings
There are tools like word2vec that are able to turn words into a vector in an embedded space. You are able to do the same thing with GANs but with pictures. For example, given a picture of a man with glasses, subtract a picture of a man, and a picture of a woman with glasses is returned.
