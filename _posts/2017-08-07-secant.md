# Secant Method

Newton's method can be computationally heavy if we cannot easily find what
\\(f'(x)\\) is. A remedy to this is the secant method. Where we use the definition
of the derivative to make an approximation for \\(f'(x)\\).

In other words, this is an alternative way to find \\(f(x) = 0\\) if you are given initial approximations of \\(p_{o}\\) and \\(p_{1}\\).

$$$              f'(p_{n-1}) = \lim_{x \to P_{n-1}}  $$$

If \\(p_{n-2}\\) is close to \\(p_(n-1)\\) then:

$$$
          f'(p_{n-1}) \approx \dfrac{f(p_{n-2})-f(p_{n-1})}{p_{n-2} - p_{n-1}}

          = \dfrac{f(p_{n-1}) - f(p_{n-2})}{p_{n-1} - p_{n-2}}

$$$

Using the approximation for \\(f'(p_{n-1})\\) in Newton's Formula gives:

$$$
      p_{n} = p_{n-1} - \dfrac{f(p_{n-1})(p_{n-1} - p_{n-2})}{f(p_{n-1} - f(p_{n-2})}

$$$
