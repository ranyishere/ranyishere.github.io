# About Me

Welcome to my personal website!

In the past I've been an energy researcher involved with batteries and the applications of
artificial intelligence/machine learning in energy management.

Currently I am interested in formal verification methods, applied category theory, and mathematical biology.

You can find my publications and projects in the tab above.

If you have a question, interesting thoughts, or just want to say hi, drop
me an email.
